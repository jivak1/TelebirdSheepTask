This is my solution for the boat sheep problem

0-unknown-0 is me as well, old account I have apparently used 3 years ago and is connected to my original account.

update: apparently I have used the wrong email while configuring git in the terminal(one linked to an alternate account i have created 3 years ago and not used since). I have updated my configuration and will be deleting said account. I am sorry for the inconvenience, but I caught the problem just now.
